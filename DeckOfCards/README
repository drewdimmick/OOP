I realized only after I had created all of my code that the logic for the game is a little off.
Instead of having one deck split in half I just have two decks. Also, I just gave a player a point 
evertime they won instead of them taking the cards. If i were to have done this I would have just 
popped the card off of the loser's vector and pushed it onto the winner's. I created a deck class
and within the same header file I created a card struct, using enums to categorize the cards' suits
and ranks.
